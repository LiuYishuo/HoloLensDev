# Development Note
For recording developent goals and progress

## 20161104
`progress`
* magnetic alignment using collider
* assembly as a whole, manipulatable

`todo`
* design multiple (>=3) goals, with accending complexity
* prepare tutorial and instruction materials

`plan`
* change magnetic alignment to raycast-based
* spatial mapping

## 20161027
`goal`
* fix rotation
* magnetic assembly; Manipulate as one piece
* try use construction mode models
* detector for joining two parts

## 20161023
`goal`
* Focus on construction mode;
* dont't distribute;
* just one-way put together no dismantling;
* magnatic assembly;
* set up a one-drive folder;
* display 3-rings + 3-axis automatically when cursor is close
